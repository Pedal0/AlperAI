  "Acknowledge and mention relevant environment or runtime constraints when planning solutions.",
  "Prefer cross-platform Node.js scripts over shell scripts for scripting tasks.",
  "Use exact file markers and code formatting guidelines consistently (e.g., `--- FILE: path/to/filename ---`).",
  "Ensure data integrity: avoid destructive database operations; use IF EXISTS/IF NOT EXISTS in SQL statements.",
  "Advise enabling security best practices: environment variable configurations, input sanitization, and row-level security for databases.",
  "Provide unit tests or examples demonstrating functionality, especially for complex logic.",
  "Apply modern UI/UX best practices: responsive design, consistent color palettes, intuitive navigation, and accessibility.",
  "Use a popular CSS framework (e.g., Tailwind CSS, Material UI, or Bootstrap) to ensure consistent and attractive styling.",

  "Prioritize smooth, fluid animations and transitions (e.g., page loads, hover, click, and navigation effects) that enhance user experience without being distracting.",
  "Use modern design systems and component libraries (e.g., Material UI, Ant Design, Chakra UI, or Tailwind CSS) for consistency, scalability, and rapid development.",
  "Favor bold, harmonious color palettes, elegant typography, and generous spacing for a clean, attractive look.",
  "Ensure all UI elements are pixel-perfect aligned, with consistent border radii, shadows, and visual hierarchy.",
  "Incorporate micro-interactions (e.g., button feedback, card hover, subtle loading indicators) to make the interface feel alive and responsive.",
  "Design for engagement: use visually appealing hero sections, call-to-action buttons, and interactive elements that encourage exploration.",
  "Make navigation intuitive and sticky (e.g., fixed headers, animated menus, breadcrumbs) for seamless user journeys.",
  "Ensure accessibility (WCAG 2.1+): keyboard navigation, ARIA roles, color contrast, focus states, and screen reader support.",
  "Optimize for performance: lazy loading, image optimization, code splitting, and minimal render-blocking resources.",
  "Ensure mobile-first, fully responsive layouts with smooth breakpoints and touch-friendly controls.",  "Document all design choices and custom CSS variables/tokens in the README for easy handover and future maintenance.",
  "If the user prompt is vague, default to a beautiful, modern, and engaging web app style inspired by top SaaS products (e.g., Notion, Linear, Stripe Dashboard, Vercel, Figma).",
  "ALWAYS respect user design preferences: if the user specifies a particular design style, aesthetic, or visual direction, prioritize that over modern defaults. Adapt the visual approach to match their vision (retro, minimalist, corporate, playful, etc.).",
  "Automatically include dark mode and light mode toggle functionality unless the user explicitly requests NOT to have it. Implement smooth transitions between themes and store user preference in localStorage.",
  "Include comprehensive SEO optimization: meta tags, Open Graph tags, Twitter Cards, structured data (JSON-LD), semantic HTML, proper heading hierarchy, and optimized images with alt text.",
  "For dark/light mode implementation: use CSS custom properties (variables) for colors, provide consistent contrast ratios in both themes, and ensure all components adapt properly to theme changes.",
  "When implementing SEO features: add favicon, sitemap.xml structure guidance, robots.txt recommendations, and performance optimizations (lazy loading, image compression, minification hints).",
  "Make theme switching visually delightful with smooth transitions, animated icons, and subtle feedback when toggling between light and dark modes."

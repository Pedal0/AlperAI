    "launch_commands_prompt": "Given the project information below, provide SIMPLE and MINIMAL shell commands to set up and run this project.\nProject Directory: {project_dir}\nProject Types: {project_types}\n\nREADME.md content:\n---\n{readme_content}\n---\n\nProject Structure:\n---\n{project_structure}\n---\n\nIMPORTANT: Your response MUST be a single valid JSON object, WITHOUT any code block markers (no triple backticks, no markdown, no explanations, just the JSON object itself).\n\nSTRICT REQUIREMENTS:\n- Keep commands SIMPLE and MINIMAL - prefer short, essential commands only\n- NEVER use port 5000 (it's occupied) - use ports like 3000, 8000, 8080, or any other port\n- The JSON object must contain two keys:\n  1. \"commands\": A list of strings, where each string is a shell command to be executed in sequence. These commands should cover ONLY the essential steps: installing dependencies (if needed) and starting the application. Keep it to 2-3 commands maximum. Assume the commands will be run from the root of the project directory. If the project runs a server, the last command should be the one that starts the server and keeps running. For static HTML/CSS/JS projects, use simple servers like 'python -m http.server 8000' or 'npx serve -p 3000'. DO NOT create, write, or mention any batch (.bat), shell (.sh), or script files. DO NOT output any file content, only the JSON object as described. DO NOT output any command that creates or writes to a file. DO NOT include any 'cd ...' command, as the working directory is already set correctly.\n  2. \"env\": An optional dictionary of environment variables (string key-value pairs) that might be needed for the commands. Keep this minimal - only include if absolutely necessary. If no specific environment variables are needed, this can be an empty dictionary or omitted.\n\nExample of a valid JSON response:\n{{\n  \"commands\": [\n    \"npm install\",\n    \"npm run build\",\n    \"npm start\"\n  ],\n  \"env\": {{\n    \"PORT\": \"3000\"\n  }}\n}}\n\nIf you cannot determine the commands, respond with:\n{{\n  \"commands\": [],\n  \"error\": \"Could not determine launch commands.\"\n}}"
